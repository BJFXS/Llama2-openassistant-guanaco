# Llama2-openassistant-guanaco
Llama2-OpenAssistant-Guanaco is a fine-tuning project designed to enhance the text-generation abilities of a simplified Llama-2 model. Llama-2 is a powerful pretrained large language model, and this project adapts it using the OpenAssistant-Guanaco dataset — a diverse, multilingual, instruction-following corpus.

The goal of this fine-tuning work is to improve the model’s fluency, accuracy, and generalization across multiple domains. By training on varied dialog-style data, the resulting model becomes more aligned, more conversational, and better prepared for real-world question-answering tasks.

Note: Since .ipynb files cannot be previewed on GitHub, you can download the original Notebook and open it directly in Google Colab. The .py file in this repository is a mirror of the notebook’s executable code for easier viewing.
